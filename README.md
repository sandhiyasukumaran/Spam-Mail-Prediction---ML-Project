# Spam Mail Classifier â€“ ML-Based Email Filtering
A machine learning-powered web app that classifies emails as spam or legitimate using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization. Built with Scikit-Learn and Streamlit for an interactive, real-time classification experience

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using classical NLP and ML techniques. A logistic regression model was trained on a dataset of 5000+ labeled emails and deployed in a Streamlit-based web app, allowing users to paste email content and get instant classification results.

## Features

- Real-time email spam detection via web interface

- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

- Logistic Regression model trained on 5000+ labeled messages

- 96% accuracy on test set

- Clean, interactive GUI built with Streamlit

## Tech Stack

1. Language: Python
  
2. Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Streamlit, Joblib

3. ML Pipeline: TfidfVectorizer + LogisticRegression

4. Deployment: Local or Streamlit Cloud
